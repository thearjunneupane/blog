Hello and welcome to yet another another dull and uninteresting blog about the fascinating realm of sonoluminescence. 
As we dive into the minutiae of bubble collapse and light emission, get ready to nod off. Will you?
Hmm! I bet you won't.
The sonoluminiscence will definitely blown your mind by the sheer excitement of collapsing bubbles and sparkling light.

## A Brief history
In 1930 F pfarm and Hfrenzel first saw the glimmer of light that results from high intensity sound waves passing through a 
liquid solution, coined as sonoluminiscence. Sonoluminiscence is derived from a latin word "sonus" and "lumin" with a suffix "-escence".
Since then this phenomenon has been studied extensively and is known to be found in a variety of liquids and gases,
such as water, alcohol, hydrocarbons, hydron and espcially a core research is made on helium.The light is incredibly brief, being only
a few billionths of a second, but highly intense.

## The Mechanism
As we all have know, the normal bubbles are formes when a gas is released under water. But sonoluminiscence have a different phenomenon.
Lets envisage a small gas bubble created by a process called Cavitation by intermittently driven it at 
supersonic frequencies of sound in a vial of liquid. 
Here the cavitaion creates bubbles. But due to the very low-pressure area of bubble in the middle of the extreme pressure of the liquid in flask, 
it tears a gap in the water, resulting in oscillating and collapsing of the bubble. Here then an incomprehensible thing crop up. 
As the bubble bursts, an uncertain flash of bluish
light emits. Measuring this emmitted light in lab founded that it is actually as enormous hot as twice the tempreture of the surface of
the sun (ie 10,000F), but lasts just for a brief time, a few billionths of second. Such spark of heat resulting to light is coined as 
sonoluminiscence. Depending on the gases that is forming cavitation, it can results in brighter bursts of light.
Furthuremore, Forming of new phase of mattter appears-'cold' plasma, which directs to the hypothesizing on the fusion inside the bubble, 
but unfortunately no further proofs endure. 

## Some popular theories
However, quite sound theories has been endured regarding the formation of such intensely heated light. Some of them are as followed:
1. Bremshallung radiation
   = The light emiting mechanism form a SBSL(single bubble sonoluminiscence) was postualted by the assumption that the bremsstahlung
is its source in partially ionized gas. The black body radiation with the defined absorption, verifies the bremsstahlung as the SBSL
mechanism with slight black body emmission nature.
2. Argon reactification hypothesis
   = This hypothesis is the assumption that the argon noble gas inside the bubble gets extremely pressurized along with high temperature.
due to this the argon atoms collides and formed excited argon atoms. And when they returns in their ground state, they release energy 
in the light form, which results the formation of intense light flash of the collapsed bubble.
3. Hotspots
   =  This theory predicts that the sound waves are concentrated in a small intensely hot spot inside the bubble. Ths severe hotness
of the bubble results in ionizing of gas in it and causes the atoms being highly energized and later on liberate energy in flash of light
during returning to ground state.

Other theories including collision-induced radiation and corona discharges, nonclassical light, proton tunneling,and electrodynamic jets 
are involved for thorisizing such phenomena. The all assumptions confined that fluid dynamics around the bubble is the key to 
sonoluminiscence. It is mystrious till this date because of its complex working mechanism.

## An eye on the Casimir energy hypthesis
The Casimir energy hypothesis describes the quantum explainations with the 'casimir effect'. In 1948, Dutch physicist Hendrik Casimir 
initially forecasted the Casimir effect, which is a force of attraction between two uncharged, adjacent conducting plates caused by the 
oscillations of the electromagnetic field in the space between them. Although the power of this Casimir force is very slight, it becomes 
more apparent when the gap between the plates is in the range of a few micrometers or even less. J. Schwinger proposed in his paper series
that the reason of sonoluminiscence could be the dynamical Casimir effect. Claudia Eberlein augmented this idea by elucidating the 
concept of quantum vacuum radiation due to zero point movements of the electric magnetic field (EMF) and computing the spectral intensity 
and emitted energy. Furthermore, she proposed that the light emitted from Sonoluminescence is produced by a vacuum inside the bubble, 
a process similar to Hawking radiation that is radiated from the boundary of black holes. In accordance to the understading of quantum 
theory that a vaccum contains virtual particles, this theory perfectly suits the explaination of the movement of the energy which is 
produced by sonoluminiscence and is in agreement with the notion of vacuum energy.


## Shrimpoluminiscence
There is an abundance range of living creatures and phenomena in nature that humanity has yet to come across or comprehend in its 
entirety, and when we eventually do, it is only because we have stumbled onto something that has existed all along.
It is the inaugural occurence of a crutacean, Mantis Shrimp generating sonoluminiscence and was fancifully dubbed "shrimpoluminescence" 
upon its discovery in 2001. 
A mantis shrimp claw is so strong that it has the capacity to deliver a powerful punch over 1500N of force despite of its small size.
When the claw snaps, the movement of the claws sets off a formation of tiny, extremely hot cavitation bubbles that have the temperature 
upto sun's surface temperature and when they burst, they discharge a powerful sound shock up to 200 decibels and also a short burst of light. 
This process is very similar to the sonoluminiscence phenomenon and fits well. The Mantis shrimp send out these shock waves to defence and
kill its prey.
Nevertheless, this effect is not as intense as the regular 
sonoluminiscence and is only visible through infrared.

## Conclusion
Scientists across the world are fascinated by sonoluminiscence and its means of functioning. From ultrasound imaging to the production 
of intense energy photons, it is all part of sonoluminiscence. It could likely be a possible energy source for the future. Eventhough we 
discovered the supermassive black holes and the tiny neutrinos, but we are unable to theorize validly about the spark of light caused by 
a small bubble.
Therefore, anyone who is able to decipher this fascinating phenomenon will undoubtedly be rewarded with a Nobel Prize. 
So, keep researching, keep learning, and keep striving to uncover the secrets of this phenomenon that lie beyond the current world's 
understanding.
